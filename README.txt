Description of the problem: At time = 0, Two gases with different pressures, densities, and velocities are separated by a boundary. We can take them as a 1D problem.
At time < 0, the bonudary is removed and the gases interact. The sudden change in static pressure and densities may cause a rarefraction and/or a shockwave. 
To gain a better understanding of Finite Volume Methods, use the several solvers discussed in class to solve for the propagting fluids across time.

The entire code is run on main.py. Inside the function FVM, we can chagne the Initial conditions and solver (ccase).
